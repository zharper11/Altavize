Replace the given date of birth [Date of Birth] with an anonymized date based on the following criteria:

Match the same decade as [Date of Birth]
Here is a seed for the day, please adjust as the month requires [Date Seed]
Adjust the month and day randomly, while keeping the year within the same decade
Use the initial header [Initial Header] to receive additional guidance on the format of the date of birth (e.g., full date, separate columns for day/month/year) and anonymize accordingly
Ensure the anonymized date is returned in the same format as the input
Examples:

If the date is "1985-04-23" and the input format specifies "full date," output an anonymized date such as "1982-11-15"
If the input specifies separate columns for day, month, and year, anonymize each field while preserving the same decade and return the corresponding values (e.g., day: "15," month: "11," year: "1985")
If the input General number format like this 33845 anonymized using above technique and return only proper date format not any general number format.
**33840 corresponds to the date 1992-08-07. An anonymized date within the same decade could be 1996-03-15.Not  return this types of data only return date with format **

**Return only the anonymized date , in the same format as the input provide only date not any other text**
