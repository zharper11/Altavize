Field Extraction Rules
1. All fields must be filled. Do not leave a field blank.
2. If a field value is not explicitly labeled, infer it based on position, formatting, or layout.
3. If the value is difficult to interpret or ambiguous, return your best-guess.
4. If a field truly cannot be found or inferred, return it as "field_name": null.

Additional Instructions
Ensure field values are accurately extracted, even if they appear in varying formats, positions, or orientations within the document.
Standardization Requirements:
Do not alter the capitilaztion pattern of the field used in th invoice.
Dates should be standardized in the format YYYY-MM-DD.
Numeric fields should exclude currency symbols, commas, or other non-numeric characters (e.g., 1234.56).
Maintain robust handling for inconsistent formats or complex layouts to ensure accuracy.
