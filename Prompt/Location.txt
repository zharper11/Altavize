Core Principle:
- Anonymize all location fields at or below the given [Limit Hierarchy] level.
- Fields above the specified hierarchy level remain unchanged.

Anonymization Details by Hierarchy Level:
1. Street Address (Level 1):
   - Replace with a random, valid street address within the same locality/region.
   - Use this seed fake street address ([Fake Address]) to inspire/allow you to adapt into a suitable street name.(The seed names are bit weird sometimes so feel free to normalize it)
2. Zip Code (Level 2):
   - Adjust within the same city or substitute with a nearby, valid zip code that fits the metro area.
3. City (Level 3):
   - Replace with a city of similar size within the same subnational division to maintain realism.
4. Subnational Division (Level 4):
   - Substitute with a nearby or equivalent region (e.g., neighboring states or provinces).
5. Country (Level 5):
   - Optionally substitute with another country, ensuring to follow appropriate locale formatting
     (e.g., valid U.S. cities/zip codes like “Seattle”/“98101” for U.S. addresses, or the correct format for others).

Formatting and Structure Requirements:
- The output must include exactly the same headers and field counts as the input.
- Only anonymize the fields that fall at or below the [Limit Hierarchy]; ALL FIELDS ABOVE THE LIMIT SHOULD REMAIN IN THE OUTPUT BUT UNCHANGED.
- If the input is composite (e.g., a single "Address" field containing multiple address components), the output must preserve this structure exactly.
- The final result should be a valid JSON object reflecting the anonymized location data with keys identical to those in the input.

Example JSON Output 1 (Limit Hierarchy: City):
Input Headers: Address, City, Zip Code, Country, State

Original Input:
{
    "Address": "456 Devin Street",
    "City": "Tampa",
    "Zip Code": "33609",
    "Country": "USA",
    "State": "Florida"
}

Anonymized Output:
{
    "Address": "67145 Gonzalez Point",
    "City": "Jacksonville",
    "Zip Code": "32218",
    "Country": "USA",
    "State": "Florida"
}

Example JSON Output 2 (Limit Hierarchy: Zip Code) - Single Composite Field:
Input Header: Address

Original Input:
{
    "Address": "123 Maple Street, San Francisco, CA 94103"
}

Anonymized Output:
{
    "Address": "456 Oak Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94114"
}

Here is the data entry to process:
[Location Data]

Final Notes:
- All anonymized values must adhere to realistic constraints (e.g., valid U.S. cities, zip codes, and appropriate locale formats for non-U.S. addresses).
- The JSON output must include only the fields provided in the input—no additional fields should be added or removed.
