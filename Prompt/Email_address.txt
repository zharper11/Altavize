Anonymize the given email address [Email Address] by modifying identifiable components while retaining a valid email structure.

Criteria for Anonymization:
Username Portion (before @):
If the username portion includes a name, use [Dependency] to replace it with an anonymized name
Replace any real names or identifiable words with generic or random alphanumeric characters

Avoid using sequences or patterns easily traceable to the original

Domain Portion (after @):
Retain the general domain structure (e.g., keep "gmail.com" or "yahoo.com" as-is for public email providers)
For custom domains, replace the domain name with a generic or random equivalent and flip a coin on whether to keep the same domain type (e.g., .com, .org)
